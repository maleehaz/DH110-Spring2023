# DH110 Assignment 6: Interface Design System
# Maleeha Zaman
## Description of Project
My goal for this project is to design a mobile platform where people of all backgrounds and ages can craft and experience their own family archive in a creative and simple way, collaborate with other family members, explore their family lineage, and have unlimited space to store important media (photos, audio recordings, documents, videos, journal entries). I decided to name the platform "Memoire", which is french for memory but also a play on how the english word "memoir" which means a historical account written from personal knowledge. It reflects the nostalgia users feel when they look back on their family memories and emphasizes the user's ability to tell a story about their own family. 
## Purpose of Interface Design
The purpose of interface design is to convert my low-fidelity wireframes into a digital form with a more developed design on Figma. Good interface design is simple, not overwhelming for the user, and separates information into readable blocks using principles of design, such as gestalt theory and color contrast accessibility. A well-designed app will make it more intuitive for users to navigate and find the information they need. The screen I decided to design was the home page, which shows the family tree which serves as a basis for the app where the user can view all their family members at once. 

## Screen Design Process

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Main Title (eg. Memoire title) | Cinzel Decorative | 40px | Regular |
| Heading 2 (eg. Search Bar, Edit Tree Button) | Averia Serif Libre | 20px | Light |

## Impression Testing
I conducted an impression test (see [recording](https://github.com/maleehaz/DH110-Spring2023/edit/main/Assignments/A06/Assignment06.md) and [transcript](https://github.com/maleehaz/DH110-Spring2023/edit/main/Assignments/A06/Assignment06.md)) over zoom.

I did a 5-second test first. I showed the design for 5 seconds then asked for her first impressions and what she could remember.

Then, I sent her the prototype link and asked her to look at the screen and give me feedback on the design. I asked for specific feedback on typography, color palette, and layout.
