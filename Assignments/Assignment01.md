# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Maleeha Zaman, DH110
## Tentative Title: Family Memory Archival 
>When my parents immigrated to America from Pakistan, they were only able to bring a few pictures with them. Whenever we did travel back to Pakistan to visit my grandparents, we found most of the photos had been lost during the moving process or misplaced. Years worth of nostalgic stories my parents told me about their younger days had been lost and it was sad they weren't able to share these memories with me. Although memories today have become digitized and encapsulated in our phone camera rolls, there is still a struggle to fully preserve those old photos our parents took on film all in one place. I plan to contribute through this UX project in order to preserve precious family memories to be shared across future generations and viewed at the user's convenience, strengthening the connection between us and our loved ones.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
_Overall Evaluation_:
<br>
<br>
### 1. Visibility of system status
The website clearly informs the user about its current status.<br>

>**GOOD**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ The site lets the user know the members being affected when they edit information on the tree by enlarging the icon of the family member.<br><img src="h1_singleenlargement.png" width=25% height=25%> <img src="h1_twoenlargement.png" width=25% height=25%>
+ The site clearly lets the user know if an invitation to view their collection has been sent by darkening the rest of the screen and showing a pop-up saying “Success!”.<br><img src="h1_success.png" width= 35% height= 35%> <br>

>**BAD**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ The site lets the user know when they are in tree editing mode by having a tab on the side appear that says “Tree Edit Mode”, however the site does not indicate when the user is in collection viewing mode. This is inconsistent and can confuse the user as to which mode of editing they are in.<br><img src= "h1_treeeditingmode.png" width=25% height=25%> <br>_Severity Rating: 2_<br>_Recommendation: Add a tab when the user is in collection viewing mode that says “Collection Viewing Mode”._ <br>

### 2. Match between system and the real world
>The website uses language that is familiar to the user and presents information in a way that is analogous to the real world<br>
**Good**: The site uses terms like "My Dashboard", "My Training", "My Tasks", "My Stories"<br>
**Bad**: The page for writing stories is called the "Creativity Center" which may not be intuitive to all users.                                                                                                          
### 3. User control and freedom

### 6. Recognition rather than recall
>The website makes information needed to navigate the website visible or easily accessible<br>
                                           
### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
>The website allows processes to be tailored to all users from novice to expert<br>                                                                                                                                                                       
### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
