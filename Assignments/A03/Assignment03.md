# Contextual Inquiry (CI)

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

## Design Challenge 

How might I design an accessible digital experience that shares the histories of Asian Americans and the current issues facing AAPI communities?

My project hopes to support users in their search for narratives that relate to them and to find sources of information on their community. In particular, this project aims to provide Asian Americans with a sense of belonging and solidarity with a community whose history has helped shaped America. 

Currently, the sources for historical narratives on Asian Americans is quite scattered online and offline. Because there are so many communities within Asian America, there are many separate websites which aim to serve these specific populations and their needs. There are few websites that consolidate this info in an easily digestible, engaging manner. In person, there are cultural organizations, including museums, that share a similar goal: to showcase the stories of Asian America to the public. However, museums are constrained by their physical location, and sometimes charge entrance fees. 

I hope that by digitizing and consolidating these histories, I can make Asian American history more accessible.

## Target Users

I want to create a website that empowers the public, including casual consumers and academic researchers, to understand the histories of Asian Americans. Because of its digital nature, users must have access to the internet.

While it is not intended to be a primary source for academic research, it may provide a broad and structured overview on issues in the Asian American literature.

Users would be able to access this collection from anywhere there is internet. On the site, they could navigate chronologically to view events in Asian American history.

## Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

 **1.	Background questions**
    a.  I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.
  
 **2.	Observation**
    a.	I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud.
  b.	When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
    a.	These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

### Contextual Inquiry Guide & Transcript
Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://github.com/yinyinwen/DH150-chuyin/blob/master/images/Contextual%20Inquiry%20Script%20for%20DH%20150.pdf).

## Insights from the interview

:one: The user feels that there is a disconnect between what goes on in academia versus in the community
> I do think that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia. And sometimes the professors...elaborate these very difficult terminologies and context and it's very hard to like relate it back to community

:two: In the initial stages of learning about a topic, the user prefers brief, well-organized sources of information
> So I definitely prefer, like, easier to consume media. And I think PBS does a great job of catering to the larger population... They have resources for both really young kids and older adults, and PBS is like one of my go-tos. I don't like Wikipedia as much because they just put a lot of information and it's hard to siphon out what's really relevant

:three: When skimming for relevant sources, the user relies on the tags accompanying each search result
> Okay, so this one looks really good "Public health and the mapping of Chinatown", right? Because it has all the words I kinda like want: "epidemics", "living conditions" 

:four: A clear timeline of events (with brief descriptions) helps the user map out their time period of interest
> So the four ordinances I'm kind of focusing on for my paper is Cubic Air ordinance, Sidewalk ordinance, Queue ordinance, and Laundry ordinance. I like how they're chronologically listed out so that I can know when and where that goes from.

## Reflection
Coming into the interview, I thought I had a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to design and who I wanted to design it for. I had envisioned a product that I would have loved to have, especially before coming to college. However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to step out of my own experience and empathize with the user's. 

This interviewee was very in touch with the Asian American cultural and political space, and she showed me how a more experienced user might engage with my product. She uses a variety of different sources to find information on Asian American narratives before, giving me insight on academic and casual sources. One memorable insight from this interview was that she felt that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia, but she still prefers easy-to-consume media when searching for sources. 

In terms of logistics, I found that creating a script for the Contextual Inquiry was quite difficult because it is impossible to know what to expect when immersing oneself in someone else's experience. I had to keep my questions loose, yet still somewhat focused. If I were to do this again, I would definitely try to ask fewer background questions and spend more time observing the user's activities. I would also follow-up more finely with the user's satisfaction and frustrations about their activities.

Talking to this user was a humbling experience, and it taught me that speaking with users directly is essential to understanding them and designing for them.
