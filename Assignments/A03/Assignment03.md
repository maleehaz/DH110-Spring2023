# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
# Maleeha Zaman

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target a user's definition of a family "memory".

## Design Challenge 

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will support users in preserving their family memories, where they can collaborate with other family members to organize their photos, videos, and stories all on one interface. By being able to easily access and add on to their family archive, users will be able to revisit a sense of nostalgia and pass on these moments as objects of rememberance and family identity to their future generations. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?  
* This activity fulfills the userâ€™s self-esteem and belonging because it helps them engage more actively with their family history. Memories provide comfort, warmth, and a feeling of belonging. Users who engage with their family memories by keeping a record help preserve their sense of identity and boost self-esteem. Furthermore, it provides a chance to connect more deeply with other members of the family by collaboratively working on an album. 

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
* The traditional solution to keep track of memories is a photo album or scrapbook, (e.g. [Physical Family Photo Album](https://www.amazon.com/Malden-International-Designs-Sentiments-Opening/dp/B01IPPC5SG/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=family%2Balbum&qid=1682380238&sr=8-3&th=1)), where users can keep their photos all in one place. One person in the family might hold onto all the family albums, the user's parents for instance, and the user would have to go visit this family member to see the pictures.
* Sometimes, users might donate their family archives to [special collections libraries](https://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/donating-familyrecs) or lose them over time as physical items are hard to keep track of and must be maintained on a consistent basis.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology? 
* Limitations in storing memories in a physical photo album include forgetting to add to it consistently everytime the user takes photos, and the user might find it tiresome to print their pictures and then arrange them. 
* Additionally, with the amount of pictures we take on our phones in this day and age, it would be impossible to keep track of every single life event in one physical place. Pictures posted on social media usage can also make it difficult to archive family memories, forcing the user to go through all the platforms they use to find the pictures they took. 
**Digitizing and consolidating all these photos across family members all in one place can make family histories more accessible and organized. It can make the process a lot more easier and efficent for the user.**


## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: Historians, librarians, or anyone interested in recording their family memories, could range from parents, grandparents, seniors, young and older adults, to occasionally teenagers
* Preferences: Users have kids or grandkids and would like to keep track of their memories as they grow up. Users who are adults and would like to keep track of the time they spend with their parents or older loved ones in general. Some might just enjoy storing and organizing photos as a hobby (eg. scrapbooking, bullet journaling). 
* Expertise: Users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project.

#### Where would the users do that activity? 
* Users can keep track of memories anywhere. The traditional method is to keep a physical family album, scrapbook, or journal of some kind which holds story entries and physical photos. The digital method is common for mobile users such that they can take a photo and can post it to social media (eg. Instagram, Facebook) or just keep it in their phone camera rolls. 
* When finding old family memories, users may consult their family members if they have any old photo albums or stories to share. Mobile users are more likely to ask other family members to send pictures from a recent family function, or view their social medias to see the pictures.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? IN PROGRESS, refer to question above
* For the traditional method, the goal of the user would be to store their photos in one place and keep them organized. They might get film developed or access their phone to print their photos out. They would buy an album or scrapbook, then paste the photos and decorate it as they please. 
* For the digital method, the goal of the user would be to add their photos to an online cloud and have it organized in an easily readable and navigable way. They would add their photos and videos to it, and maybe include captions. These albums can also include timestamps and can be organized chronologically for a better viewing experience. 


## Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted over Zoom, and the participant felt more comfortable talking off-camera. Only the screen and the audio was recorded during this session. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

 **1.	Background questions**
 * I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and build rapport before progressing with the interview. I wanted to know what family memories meant to them and how my website/app could support their needs.
  
 **2.	Observation**
 * I allowed the user to sketch how they would organize their family tree and what a typical family album would look to them. 
 * I often asked follow-up questions about their sketches, and went a bit off-script, to gauge why they chose to arrange or include something.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
 * These were directive. I sought to understand why the user instinctively chose to arrange memories the way they did, and what digital applications they leaned towards in terms of saving photos and videos.

### Contextual Inquiry Guide & Transcript
Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://github.com/yinyinwen/DH150-chuyin/blob/master/images/Contextual%20Inquiry%20Script%20for%20DH%20150.pdf).

## Insights from the interview

:one: The user feels that there is a disconnect between what goes on in academia versus in the community
> I do think that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia. And sometimes the professors...elaborate these very difficult terminologies and context and it's very hard to like relate it back to community

:two: In the initial stages of learning about a topic, the user prefers brief, well-organized sources of information
> So I definitely prefer, like, easier to consume media. And I think PBS does a great job of catering to the larger population... They have resources for both really young kids and older adults, and PBS is like one of my go-tos. I don't like Wikipedia as much because they just put a lot of information and it's hard to siphon out what's really relevant

:three: When skimming for relevant sources, the user relies on the tags accompanying each search result
> Okay, so this one looks really good "Public health and the mapping of Chinatown", right? Because it has all the words I kinda like want: "epidemics", "living conditions" 

:four: A clear timeline of events (with brief descriptions) helps the user map out their time period of interest
> So the four ordinances I'm kind of focusing on for my paper is Cubic Air ordinance, Sidewalk ordinance, Queue ordinance, and Laundry ordinance. I like how they're chronologically listed out so that I can know when and where that goes from.

## Reflection
Initially, I came into the interview with an idea to design a website to organize family photos, videos, and stories into a family tree. I envisioned a product that I would personally apply to my own family. However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to empathize with users of all backgrounds and redefine what family means to different people, and how users perceive a memory. 

The interviewee was only really close to a few of her family members, being mostly closely with her dad because her parents are divorced. She showed me how a user who doesn't have a conventional nuclear family might perceive the product and offered a variety of insights on how she would interact with a family archive. One memorable insight is how she felt her dad would be more inclined to store memories in the form of her lineage because they have Native American roots in addition to her being Salvadorian. She said she does feel more inclined to keep family memories of the family circle whom she considers the most important in her life, although the idea of seeing her whole family tree sounds interesting. My interviewee also mentions the personability and warmth that comes with physical items, emphasizing how she liked to scrapbook receipts, movie tickets, or candy wrappers into her albums. I would like to incorporate personal items into my design in addition to photos, videos, and text, as well as trying to enforce a less strict format for a family collection (make it more customizable).
In terms of logistics, I found that creating a script for the Contextual Inquiry was quite difficult because it is impossible to know what to expect when immersing oneself in someone else's experience. I had to keep my questions loose, yet still somewhat focused. If I were to do this again, I would definitely try to ask fewer background questions and spend more time observing the user's activities. I would also follow-up more finely with the user's satisfaction and frustrations about their activities.

Talking to this user was a humbling experience, and it taught me that speaking with users directly is essential to understanding them and designing for them.
