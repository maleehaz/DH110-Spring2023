      <p class="lead">by Yinyin Wen</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>Understanding the history of our people empowers us to stand in solidarity with our contemporary communities. As Asian Americans, our histories are not always easily accessible through mainstream institutions. Throughout US history, the narratives of Asian Americans have been marginalized and erased. With this project, I want to create a digital space for those narratives to be shared. </p>

        <p class="card-text">Currently, the sources for historical narratives on Asian Americans are scattered and siloed along ethnic boundaries. Because there are many communities within Asian America, there are myriad websites which aim to serve each population and its needs. Few websites consolidate this info in an easily digestible, engaging manner. While museums serve this goal, they are constrained by their physical location and may charge entrance fees. Thus, I looked to create a digital platform that overcomes these barriers. <br><br> 

        My project hopes to support users in their search for narratives about a community whose contributions have helped shape America. This includes people of different backgrounds, ages, and stations in life. This website aims to encourage a deeper understanding of the diversity of Asian American communities by allowing these stories to coexist in one place. I want to create a website that empowers the public, including casual consumers and academic researchers, to understand the histories of Asian Americans.

            <h5 class="card-title">Competitor Analysis</h5>
            <p class="card-text">To get a sense of how other websites were presenting information on arts and culture, I conducted heuristic evaluations on two virtual museum sites: The Frick Collection and the Virtual Asian American Art Museum. I chose to analyze these two sites because they represented two very different approaches to solving a similar problem. By evaluating them against the heuristics compiled by N/N Group, I saw how these heuristics played into the product that I was aiming to create – a destination for cultural information. <br><br>
            
            From these two websites, I found that I wanted to balance innovation with familiarity – to create a site that was inspiring yet still felt easy to learn. I also wanted to break down the information on my website into bite-sized pieces to make it more approachable to users.

            <p class="card-text">Despite having an idea of what I wanted for the final product, I knew I had to learn more about what the users wanted and needed. My classmate, an Asian American Studies major, offered to give me a glimpse into what her day looked like. <br><br>

            I went into our Zoom call not knowing what insights I would glean but knowing that I wanted to see how she discovered information about a topic of interest. After discussing some background questions, I asked if she could show me how she typically finds information on the internet. It turns out she had been starting on her senior thesis on Asian American issues and decided to show me how she found sources for her paper.

            <p class="card-text">One central way to develop empathy for our users is to take their perspective. We can do this by creating personas, scenarios, user journeys, and empathy maps. These transport us out of our own lives and into the lives of our users. Throughout the design process, we can think back to our users' context through these materials. <br><br>

            Drawing from the contextual inquiry findings, I created a persona that captured the motivations, needs, and goals of the participant. Because I wanted to create a product for users from diverse backgrounds, I created two additional proto-personas by synthesizing information from the contextual inquiry and from my recollection of people in my life.

            <p class="card-text">Taking the perspective of my personas led me to incorporate three different features into my website. I wanted to allow users to: <br><br>
            •	Explore the history of Asian American communities with an interactive timeline
            •	Watch videos and documentaries about art, culture, social issues, and politics
            •	Find teaching resources to support curriculums related to Asian American topics<br><br>
            With these scenarios in mind, I took to translating them into tangible screen designs. Because the site centers around history, education, and culture, I wanted it to exude a professional, sophisticated air. At the same time, I wanted it to be approachable and refreshing.

These low-fidelity prototypes allowed me to evaluate whether users could understand the website flow. Based on the three user personas and scenarios, I crafted three tasks to test with a participant: <br><br>
            1.	Finding more about a historical event on the timeline
            2.	Download a file for a lesson plan
            3.	View a video documentary

            <p class="card-text">To bring my project to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This helped me envision what the end product might look like and provided a concrete visualization that could be tested with users. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I could iterate towards a better user experience.
