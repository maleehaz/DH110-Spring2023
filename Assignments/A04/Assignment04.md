# DH110 Assignment 4: Personas & Scenarios
# Maleeha Zaman

During this process, I found many of my design ideas changed after inquiring more about my target users. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target a user's definition of a family memory.

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling helps researchers stay in touch with their users and is a great practice of user-centered design. It helps filter out any biases by reflecting on the user's background, feelings, and motivations. Creating different personas and scenarios, I was able to gain a more thorough understanding of my target users by viewing them from various perspectives and empathizing with their frustrations and desires.

## Scenarios & Journey Maps
### 1. Samra
#### Why Samra is using this product
> Samra works as a nurse at UCLA Health and lives in Santa Clarita with her husband and her daughter, Mina. Mina is 5 years old and recently just started preschool. Samra can't believe that 5 years had already passed since her daughter was first born, and feels like time is flying by. As a young mother, Samra loves to take lots of pictures of her daughter at any occasion, always spamming the camera at any moment's notice. Her parents are always asking for updates but she has trouble finding the right pictures to send them because there are so many. Samra wants a place where she can easily search through and sort photos and videos of her daughter, something simple wher she doesn't have to worry about storage space.
#### How Samra is using this product
> Since it was recently her daughter's first time dressing up for Halloween at school, Samra decides to consolidate all her daughter's firsts and wants to make an album. Samra makes a profile for her daughter and creates a new album called "My Lovely Mina". She selects the photos she wants to save from her phone and organizes them into different stories such as "Mina's First Day of School", "Mina's Halloween", and "Mina's Birthdays". Samra can also add little blurbs alongside her photos, such as "When Mina made her first friend at school". After sorting through the photos, she can search for specific ones by typing a keyword, such as "First Day" or "friend" to find photos related to Mina's first day at school.
