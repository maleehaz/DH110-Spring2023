# DH110 Assignment 4: Personas & Scenarios
# Maleeha Zaman

During this process, I found many of my design ideas changed after inquiring more about my target users. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target a user's definition of a family memory.

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling helps researchers stay in touch with their users and is a great practice of user-centered design. It helps filter out any biases by reflecting on the user's background, feelings, and motivations. Creating different personas and scenarios, I was able to gain a more thorough understanding of my target users by viewing them from various perspectives and empathizing with their frustrations and desires.
