        <p class="card-text"> Currently we live in the age of digitization where most of our recent photos are stored within our phones. The film photos, vhs tapes, and documents our older family members hold onto catch dust in family albums or multitudes of boxes stored in the attic. Most users have to call their grandparents for old yearbook photos of their parents or dig through their family albums to find a baby photo of themselves. Furthermore, while there are many cloud-sharing apps (eg. Google Photos, DropBox, etc.), none of them offer a particular creative and enjoyable way to organize a family archive, and feel more like digital boxes in the attic that carries hundreds of photos a user might never look back on.  <br> 

        My project aims to support users in telling a story about their families and keeping track of their lineage. Users can collaborate with other family members to create and add to a family archive. This app would be accessible to people of different ages, backgrounds, and family structures. I want to create an app that encourages users to engage with their family memories in an enjoyable and intuitive way, and build a family history that their future generations can look back on.

            <h5 class="card-title">Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> To get a sense of how users might choose to record family memories, I conducted a heuristic evaluation (using Jakob Nielson's 10 Heuristics) of the websites Collectionaire and MyStoriesMatter. I chose to analyze these two sites because they represented two very different approaches to family memories. Collectionaire uses a family tree and users can access albums specific to each family member. MyStoriesMatter is more like a social media platform specific to family members, where users can share journal entries about any stories or thoughts they have with their family.  <br>
            
            By evaluating them against the heuristics, I saw how users can act as both storytellers and historians for their families. From these two websites, I wanted to balance intuitive functionalities with creativity, making sure the app is simple enough for any user from any age bracket can understand while also giving them the oppurtunity to explore their family history in different ways.

            <p class="card-text"> The purpose of usability testing is to identify any issues within the design and interface of the produce by observing users. By gathering feedback from users on the website Collectionaire, I gained a better understanding of their needs and what needs to be improved to increase the site's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.  <br>
            
            In my pilot UT, I tested for tasks using Collectionaire's photo storage, family tree, and sharing features. I learned from my participant the family tree editor wasn't too intuitive and the vocabulary used for some options was difficult to understand.

            <p class="card-text">To learn more about my target users, I conducted a contextual inquiry with my friend over Zoom who was comfortable with sharing information about her family with me and asked her about how she goes about recording and viewing her family memories. I asked the user to sketch how they would organize their family tree and what a typical family album layout looks like to them. <br>

            Some interesting insights I learned is they like to record personal keepsakes alongside their photos (eg. train tickets, candy wrappers) and they prefer to group memories based on who is in the picture rather than by individual members. From this inquiry, I thought about including features such as scanning and tagging specific family members in an archive entry.
