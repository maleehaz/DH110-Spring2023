# DH110 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing

## Introduction

**Collectionaire** is a website with a mission to archive family memories and document family history. It allows people to import using a GEDCOM(genealogy) file or build their own family tree, and create collections specific to families within the family or single family members. Users must sign up to create an account in order to start creating collections and adding memories. Users are able to add linked albums from external sources such as Google Photos or iCloud, add images, create timelines, organize albums by a chapter in their life, and build profiles and descriptions for each family member. They can also share their collections or linked albums with other users to view or work on them collaboratively.  

## Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of a usability test is to improve the usability of the product by observing and testing the users and gathering their feedback. The usability test helps to identify specific problems from a heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product. 

## Methodology

The UT will test the three metrics of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. I moderated the usability test with my brother as the participant over zoom where both of us were in quiet rooms. The **pre-test questionnaire** measures the user's first impressions of the website homepage. I observed the user interact with the app through three **task scenarios** to learn how the website design affects the user’s ability to complete routine tasks. The **post-test questionnaire** measures the user's experience using the website, in terms of ease, time, likelihood to do the task again. The **System Usability Scale** measures the user's attitude toward the website and its usability. The **Product Satisfaction Cards** determine how the website makes them feel by having them select five words that describes their personal experience. The entire process took about 35 minutes.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Recognition rather than recall  | The user needs extra time to get used to the editing interface and its different modes, and the terms it uses (eg. trees, collections, chapters, linked albums).  | Add a profile to the family tree and create a linked album.  |  
Consistency and standards | The sharing functionality does not use intuitive design and vocabulary that a user would understand based on their experiences with other products, making it difficult to share an album.  | Share an album with another user and grant them editing permissions.  |
Match between system and real world  | Marking a profile as a "person with a story of significance" and finding the "Family History" can be confusing to the user. It doesn't exactly speak the user's language and forces them to make a lot of inferences as to what they mean and how to navigate through these tasks. | Mark a profile as a "person with a story of significance" and find the family history collection. |


**Process of the Usability Test:**
1. Introduction
2. Informed Consent
3. Background Questions
4. Pre-Test Questions
5. Three Task Scenarios 
6. Post-Test Questionnaire
7. System Usability Scale 
8. Product Satisfaction Card
9. Demographics

I couldn't meet with the user in person, so we conducted our meeting over **Zoom**. I used Zoom to record the session which video recorded the participant and myself, as well as the participant's laptop screen. I stopped the recording after thanking the participant for their time afterwards. Furthermore, I didn't have the survey side by side with the website open. It didn't feel intuitive to have the website being open in the narrow window because I felt it would inhibit the user's ability to navigate through it. Instead, I had the user have both the survey and the website open in separate tabs and have them switch between the two.

## Reflection

Overall, the usability testing went smoothly, with few issues. There was a typo on the System Usability Scale section on my google form, where I accidentally included two extra sections that said "Very Likely" and "Somewhat likely", which confused my participant while using the form. I definitely learned its important to check and proofread your materials often when conducting usability tests, making sure they're readable and easy to understand for the user we are testing. 

I tried to be as unbiased during the usability test as much as possible, expressing empathy toward my participant by being patient and answering any questions they had during the tasks. I did find myself to be impatient because sometimes the participant didn't fully read the task and quickly switched back to the website to innaccurately complete the task. I found myself having to reiterate the task to the participant to make sure their goals aligned with the task at hand. Having the split screen between the google form and the website probably would have solved this issue, but when I was analyzing the website myself, I found the narrow window to be a lot more difficult to navigate (as well as some of the options disappearing). I would probably have to write out my tasks a lot better to make them easier to understand for the user, because my participant was confused about some of the wording of the tasks. 

My participant was very outspoken and made sure to discuss their thought process, which I found as overall helpful insights toward my project. There were definitely some major heuristic issues with Collectionaire's collection and family tree editor that made it difficult to navigate for the participant. My participant was also in their early 20s, and I would think someone who is older and less experienced with technology would definitely struggle with this site. Overall, I hope to do more usability tests because I enjoyed observing the thought process of a user as they interact with an interface. I hope to get more comfortable with interviewing and making my participants feel at most ease as possible. I definitely felt a bit nervous my first time and feel like I could've still stressed out my participant a bit, so I hope to improve and build trust with my participants in the future. I also hope to get more used to the process and be more well prepared in terms of my materials, so I can minimize any difficulties and be more flexible when dealing with unexpected challenges.
