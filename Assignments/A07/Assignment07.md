# DH110 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
# Maleeha Zaman

## Overview
My project is a family archival app called "Memoire" where users can can craft and experience their own family archive in a creative and simple way, collaborate with other family members, explore their family lineage, and have unlimited space to store important media (photos, audio recordings, documents, videos, journal entries). 

**Purpose of Interactive Prototype**: The following interactive prototype is designed to solve and illustrate four features for family archival, family sharing, and media uploading/scanning. The purpose of creating this high-fidelity prototype is to visualize important functions and make improvements to user interactions and design. 

## Tasks 
1. Add a new member to the family tree
> **Scenario**: Imagine your aunt, Zara Abdul, recently gave birth to a newborn baby boy so you want to add him to the family tree. Add Zara's newborn son Bilal Abdul to the family tree.
  
> _User will click edit tree, then click on edit members. The user must input the new member's first and last name, and their position on the family tree (select a member and select their relation to that member). The user also has the option to upload a profile photo, but this is not required when adding a member. Then the user must input the member's birthday, and whether they are deceased. The user also has the option to input the member's gender, middle name, and a short description of them. The user then clicks save and is notified they added a member. They must click save again to exit the family tree editing mode._

2. Play a timelapse of a family member
> **Scenario**: Imagine your dad, Amir Khan, wants to share how he looked when he was younger with you and how he has changed over the years. Your dad already has photos of his younger self in the archive, so you're curious as to whether you can play a timelapse of him over the years. Play a timelapse of Amir Khan.

> _The user clicks on Amir Khan's profile and is navigated to a page with details about the family member. At the corner of their profile picture is a play button, which they click and are navigated to the page about the timelapse. They select settings (how many pictures to show and whether transitions are manual or automatic) for the timelapse and click the play timelapse button._  

3. Invite a family member, who also has an account, to edit and view the family archive
> **Scenario**: Imagine you want to invite your sister who also has a Memoire account to edit and view the family archive. Your sister, Sarah Khan, has lots of pictures from her birthday that you want her to add. Invite Sarah Khan to edit and view the family archive.
 
> _The user clicks on the share button on the bottom navigation bar. Then they click on search profiles and type in Sarah Khan's username "sarahkhan01", and her profile pops up. The user would click on her profile and be prompted as to whether they want to invite the profile. The user would select yes and be notified that the profile was invited._

4. Scan a document and add it to one of the entries in one of your archives
> **Scenario**: You visit your cousin, Yasmin Yusof, who just graduated high school. She shows you her high school diploma and you recall Yasmin forgot to add the diploma to the archive. You decide to scan her diploma and add it to her entry for her high school graduation. Find the entry for Yasmin's high school graduation, then scan and add her diploma to it.

> _The user clicks on archives on the navigation bar. They will look through the archives and find and click one called "High School Graduations". They would click on the entry box labelled "Yasmin finishes HS", which will navigate the user to a full page with the entire gallery within the entry. They will then click on add media where they will be prompted with pop-up asking them whether to scan or upload. They would click on scan and be directed to a camera with edge-detecting software where they will be able to scan the diploma. They will then click on add scans which is in the bottom right corner, where they will be prompted as to whether they want to add a caption. The user may add a caption if they choose, then click add to entry where the system will notfy them that the scan was added to the entry's gallery._
