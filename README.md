      <p>Understanding the history of our people empowers us to stand in solidarity with our contemporary communities. As Asian Americans, our histories are not always easily accessible through mainstream institutions. Throughout US history, the narratives of Asian Americans have been marginalized and erased. With this project, I want to create a digital space for those narratives to be shared. </p>
