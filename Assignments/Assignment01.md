# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Maleeha Zaman, DH110
## Tentative Title: Family Memory Archival 
When my parents immigrated to America from Pakistan, they were only able to bring a few pictures with them and had to leave most of them at home. I've always wanted to see lots of pictures of my mom because she would always talk about how she was very popular with guys when she was young and her crazy adventures during her college days. When we did travel back to Pakistan to visit my grandparents, however, we found most of the photos had been lost during the moving process or misplaced. Losing these pictures felt like years worth of precious memories had been lost and they were saddened they weren't able to share these memories with me. 

I feel preserving both new and old photos of our loved ones is more important than ever, so we can share with our future generations and be able to look back at them at our convenience. In this age, memory archival has become vastly digitized, such that most of the photos we take are stored in our phones. However, this does not account for the past of our parents and grandparents, where most of their photos are physical due to film photography being the primary means of recording memories of their younger days. I want to contribute with this UX project by creating a website or app to preserve the precious memories of family members and make it convenient for any member of the family to upload the photos they have and view them all in one place. 

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, Collectionaire, documents family trees with memories all in one place where it can be viewed by anyone in the family. The second, My Stories Matter, is a collaborative story book where family members can contribute journal entries and photos.

#### Background Information
Collectionaire is a website with a mission to document family history and archive immediate family's memories. To do this, users can make an account, go to their "Create a new collection", and select a type of collection to make (Family Tree or Organization structure). From there, users can build a family tree or import a FamilySearch or GEDCOM file as a tree. The website has extensive information on what Connectionaire is, services that they provide, and video tutorials.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website clearly informs the user about its current status | **Good**:The site lets the user know the members being affected when they edit information on the tree by enlarging the icon of the family member<br>![singleicon](h1_singleiconenlargement.png | width = 100)<br>![twoicon](h1_twoiconenlargement.png)<br>**Good**:The site clearly lets the user know if an invitation to view their collection has been sent by darkening the rest of the screen and showing a pop-up saying “Success!”.<br>![success](h1_success.png)<br>**Bad**:The site lets the user know when they are in tree editing mode by having a tab on the side appear that says “Tree Edit Mode”, however the site does not indicate when the user is in collection viewing mode. This is inconsistent and can confuse the user as to which mode of editing they are in.<br>![treeeditmode](h1_treeeditingmode.png)<br>_Severity Rating: 2_<br>_Recommendation: Add a tab when the user is in collection viewing mode that says “Collection Viewing Mode”._ |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The website uses language that is familiar to the user and presents information in a way that is analogous to the real world | **Good**: The site uses terms like "My Dashboard", "My Training", "My Tasks", "My Stories"<br>**Bad**: The page for writing stories is called the "Creativity Center" which may not be intuitive to all users.|

These menu options collapse into a sidebar with three lines when the window width is narrow.<br>**Good**: Clicking on "TimeSlips" on the top of any page takes the user back to the home page.<br>**Bad**: The sidebar menu is a standard convention, but may be more difficult for seniors to navigate than having options available at the top of the page.| 
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website prevents errors by reducing error-prone conditions or checking for them and notifying the user                                          | **Bad**: The text input box for storytelling does not have spelling and grammar check options.<br>**Bad**: On the storytelling page, the site lets me navigate to a new page without saving my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
