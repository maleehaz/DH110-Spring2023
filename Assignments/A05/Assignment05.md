# DH110 Assignment 5: Low-fidelity Prototype
# Maleeha Zaman

I want to create an app that allows people to create an archive of their family history and lineage, and work collaboratively on this archive with other family members, based on the family archival website Collectionaire. My ultimate goal is to help users bond more with their family members through a simple and creative way to organize and view their memories. The app will allow users to:
1. Explore and record their family lineage with a family tree
2. Build and add on to the family archive with entries by uploading or scanning media directly, and writing journal entries
4. View a timelapse of each family member through their profile
5. Invite other family members to be able to view and edit the archive
To evaluate the logic and flow of the screens of the app, I created low-fidelity prototypes to test these features to identify any problems early on and continue to revise my design.

### Research that Informed Design of the Low-Fi Prototype
  *  Based on my heuristic evaluation of the Collectionaire website, I found that the site had issues in providing helpful information to aid navigation (recognition rather than recall) and waws rather complex, particularly of their editing collections and trees features that was difficult and confusing to navigate without a tutorial. The site also didn't have too much flexibility, in which the user could only be a part of a single archive and there were no options to include audio recordings within the collections. 
  *  During my usability testing, I found that the additional issues of lack of visibility of system status concerning the family tree. My participant struggled to find a family member because the tree condensed without notifying them, and they had no clue how to uncondense the tree. I also found the website tended to provide too much information in regards to sharing an archive with another profile, such that my participant got confused over the sharing permissions and had to read them over again to understand what they meant. Particularly, my participant noted it was a lot of jargon for what is supposed to be a simple sharing function. 
  *  In my user research and contextual interview, I realized a family archive is more than a cloud-based photo storage space for family photos, but a creative outlet for family storytelling. I found the motivation to record family memories is to preserve the core parts and warmth felt during those times, supplemented with physical keepsakes such as receipts or candy wrappers that the memory more personable for the user. I realized giving the user the creative freedom to view and craft entries in the archive gives them the oppurtunity to express and have agency over their own family story. My participant also tended to view their closest loved ones based on certain snippets of their lives, which gave me the idea to incorporate 
* Personas (see (here)[https://github.com/maleehaz/DH110-Spring2023/blob/main/Assignments/A04/Assignment04.md])
  From the above findings, I created two personas:
  * Samra, a full-time nurse and mother who wants to log every memory she has with her daughter
  * Debbie, an aspiring family archivist who has boxes of old photos and wants to share them with her distant grandchildren
