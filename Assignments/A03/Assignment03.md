# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
# Maleeha Zaman

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

## Design Challenge IN PROGRESS

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will support users in preserving their family memories, where they can collaborate with other family members to organize their photos, videos, and stories all on one interface. By being able to easily access and add on to their family archive, users will be able to revisit a sense of nostalgia and pass on these moments as objects of rememberance and family identity to their future generations. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?  
* This activity fulfills the userâ€™s self-esteem and belonging because it helps them engage more actively with their family history. Memories provide comfort, warmth, and a feeling of belonging. Users who engage with their family memories by keeping a record help preserve their sense of identity and boost self-esteem. Furthermore, it provides a chance to connect more deeply with other members of the family by collaboratively working on an album. 

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
* The traditional solution to keep track of memories is a photo album or scrapbook, (e.g. [Physical Family Photo Album](https://www.amazon.com/Malden-International-Designs-Sentiments-Opening/dp/B01IPPC5SG/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=family%2Balbum&qid=1682380238&sr=8-3&th=1)), where users can keep their photos all in one place. One person in the family might hold onto all the family albums, the user's parents for instance, and the user would have to go visit this family member to see the pictures.
* Sometimes, users might donate their family archives to [special collections libraries](https://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/donating-familyrecs) or lose them over time as physical items are hard to keep track of and must be maintained on a consistent basis.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology? 
* Limitations in storing memories in a physical photo album include forgetting to add to it consistently everytime the user takes photos, and the user might find it tiresome to print their pictures and then arrange them. 
* Additionally, with the amount of pictures we take on our phones in this day and age, it would be impossible to keep track of every single life event in one physical place. Pictures posted on social media usage can also make it difficult to archive family memories, forcing the user to go through all the platforms they use to find the pictures they took. 
**Digitizing and consolidating all these photos across family members all in one place can make family histories more accessible and organized. It can make the process a lot more easier and efficent for the user.**


## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: Historians, librarians, or anyone interested in recording their family memories, could range from parents, grandparents, seniors, young and older adults, to occasionally teenagers
* Preferences: Users have kids or grandkids and would like to keep track of their memories as they grow up. Users who are adults and would like to keep track of the time they spend with their parents or older loved ones in general. Some might just enjoy storing and organizing photos as a hobby (eg. scrapbooking, bullet journaling). 
* Expertise: Users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project.

#### Where would the users do that activity? 
* Users can keep track of memories anywhere. The traditional method is to keep a physical family album, scrapbook, or journal of some kind which holds story entries and physical photos. The digital method is common for mobile users such that they can take a photo and can post it to social media (eg. Instagram, Facebook) or just keep it in their phone camera rolls. 
* When finding old family memories, users may consult their family members if they have any old photo albums or stories to share. Mobile users are more likely to ask other family members to send pictures from a recent family function, or view their social medias to see the pictures.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? IN PROGRESS, refer to question above
* IN PROGRESS
* The goal of the user would be to add their photos to a collaborative family album and have it organized in an easily readable and navigable way. To do that, they would be able to add collaborators and family profiles to a tree. They would search for their profile and make an album, then add their photos, vidoes, and stories to it. These albums can also include timestamps and can be organized chronologically for a better viewing experience. 


## Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

 **1.	Background questions**
 * I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.
  
 **2.	Observation**
 * I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud.
 * When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
 * These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

### Contextual Inquiry Guide & Transcript
Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://github.com/yinyinwen/DH150-chuyin/blob/master/images/Contextual%20Inquiry%20Script%20for%20DH%20150.pdf).

## Insights from the interview

:one: The user feels that there is a disconnect between what goes on in academia versus in the community
> I do think that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia. And sometimes the professors...elaborate these very difficult terminologies and context and it's very hard to like relate it back to community

:two: In the initial stages of learning about a topic, the user prefers brief, well-organized sources of information
> So I definitely prefer, like, easier to consume media. And I think PBS does a great job of catering to the larger population... They have resources for both really young kids and older adults, and PBS is like one of my go-tos. I don't like Wikipedia as much because they just put a lot of information and it's hard to siphon out what's really relevant

:three: When skimming for relevant sources, the user relies on the tags accompanying each search result
> Okay, so this one looks really good "Public health and the mapping of Chinatown", right? Because it has all the words I kinda like want: "epidemics", "living conditions" 

:four: A clear timeline of events (with brief descriptions) helps the user map out their time period of interest
> So the four ordinances I'm kind of focusing on for my paper is Cubic Air ordinance, Sidewalk ordinance, Queue ordinance, and Laundry ordinance. I like how they're chronologically listed out so that I can know when and where that goes from.

## Reflection
Coming into the interview, I thought I had a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to design and who I wanted to design it for. I had envisioned a product that I would have loved to have, especially before coming to college. However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to step out of my own experience and empathize with the user's. 

This interviewee was very in touch with the Asian American cultural and political space, and she showed me how a more experienced user might engage with my product. She uses a variety of different sources to find information on Asian American narratives before, giving me insight on academic and casual sources. One memorable insight from this interview was that she felt that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia, but she still prefers easy-to-consume media when searching for sources. 

In terms of logistics, I found that creating a script for the Contextual Inquiry was quite difficult because it is impossible to know what to expect when immersing oneself in someone else's experience. I had to keep my questions loose, yet still somewhat focused. If I were to do this again, I would definitely try to ask fewer background questions and spend more time observing the user's activities. I would also follow-up more finely with the user's satisfaction and frustrations about their activities.

Talking to this user was a humbling experience, and it taught me that speaking with users directly is essential to understanding them and designing for them.
