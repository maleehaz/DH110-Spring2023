# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
# Maleeha Zaman

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

## Design Challenge 

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will support users in tracking books they read, as well as finding books they want to read. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
* This activity fulfills the user’s esteem needs, more specifically esteem for oneself, 
as reading books and keeping track of them gives them a feeling of accomplishment. 
By finding books to read and keeping track of them, users will be able to feel accomplished that they have gained knowledge.

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
* The traditional solution to keep track of books people read is a “book log.” 
In a very basic book log, readers can write the title of the book and the author, 
in addition to a personal rating of the book and page numbers. 
There are products such as a book log journal (e.g. [Book Lover's Journal Reading Organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Lovers-Journal-Reading-Organizer/dp/1441304827/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=book+log&qid=1587935107&sr=8-3)), 
where readers can keep track of the books they have in one place. 
* In terms of finding books, according to a research conducted by Pew Research Center in 2011, 
64% of those ages 16 and older said they get book recommendations by word of mouth, from family members, 
friends, and co-workers. Other sources include online bookstores or other websites, 
recommendations from staffers in bookstores, or librarians. (["Where People Discover and Get Their Books"](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2012/06/22/part-2-where-people-discover-and-get-their-books/)) 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Limitations in keeping track of books may be forgetting to write down each time a user finishes a book. 
In addition, having something like a book log journal may be tiresome, especially if people who travel often 
do not want to carry around extra items. Thus, digital technology can improve portability and make it easier 
for users to remember to keep track. 
* When finding books, people can find books from a wider social circle through technology that would 
allow them to find a diverse range of genres and topics. 


## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: students (high school, college undergraduates), working adults, and people who are college-educated
* Preferences: users read as a hobby, or want to read for personal development, 
and thus would want to keep track of books they read and get book recommendations
* Expertise: users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project

#### Where would the users do that activity?
* Users can keep track of books anywhere; in the traditional method, as long as they have a piece of 
paper and pen, they can write down what book they read. 
In a digital method, users can log what they read anywhere at anytime, as long as they have their device.
* When finding books to read, users may do that activity in many different places—a library or a bookstore, 
or even in daily conversations with their family, friends, or co-workers, or online in an online book recommendation.  

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
* The goal of the users would be to log a book they read. To do that, they would either physically write down 
information about that book, or type it in a device to record information. To find a book to read, users may search online, 
go to a library or bookstore to browse books on their own or ask the staff, or ask their friends or family 
about book recommendations.


## Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

 **1.	Background questions**
    a.  I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.
  
 **2.	Observation**
    a.	I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud.
  b.	When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
    a.	These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

### Contextual Inquiry Guide & Transcript
Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://github.com/yinyinwen/DH150-chuyin/blob/master/images/Contextual%20Inquiry%20Script%20for%20DH%20150.pdf).

## Insights from the interview

:one: The user feels that there is a disconnect between what goes on in academia versus in the community
> I do think that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia. And sometimes the professors...elaborate these very difficult terminologies and context and it's very hard to like relate it back to community

:two: In the initial stages of learning about a topic, the user prefers brief, well-organized sources of information
> So I definitely prefer, like, easier to consume media. And I think PBS does a great job of catering to the larger population... They have resources for both really young kids and older adults, and PBS is like one of my go-tos. I don't like Wikipedia as much because they just put a lot of information and it's hard to siphon out what's really relevant

:three: When skimming for relevant sources, the user relies on the tags accompanying each search result
> Okay, so this one looks really good "Public health and the mapping of Chinatown", right? Because it has all the words I kinda like want: "epidemics", "living conditions" 

:four: A clear timeline of events (with brief descriptions) helps the user map out their time period of interest
> So the four ordinances I'm kind of focusing on for my paper is Cubic Air ordinance, Sidewalk ordinance, Queue ordinance, and Laundry ordinance. I like how they're chronologically listed out so that I can know when and where that goes from.

## Reflection
Coming into the interview, I thought I had a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to design and who I wanted to design it for. I had envisioned a product that I would have loved to have, especially before coming to college. However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to step out of my own experience and empathize with the user's. 

This interviewee was very in touch with the Asian American cultural and political space, and she showed me how a more experienced user might engage with my product. She uses a variety of different sources to find information on Asian American narratives before, giving me insight on academic and casual sources. One memorable insight from this interview was that she felt that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia, but she still prefers easy-to-consume media when searching for sources. 

In terms of logistics, I found that creating a script for the Contextual Inquiry was quite difficult because it is impossible to know what to expect when immersing oneself in someone else's experience. I had to keep my questions loose, yet still somewhat focused. If I were to do this again, I would definitely try to ask fewer background questions and spend more time observing the user's activities. I would also follow-up more finely with the user's satisfaction and frustrations about their activities.

Talking to this user was a humbling experience, and it taught me that speaking with users directly is essential to understanding them and designing for them.
