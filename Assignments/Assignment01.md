# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Maleeha Zaman, DH110
## Tentative Title: Family Memory Archival 
When my parents immigrated to America from Pakistan, they were only able to bring a few pictures with them and had to leave most of them at home. I've always wanted to see lots of pictures of my mom because she would always talk about how she was very popular with guys when she was young and her crazy adventures during her college days. When we did travel back to Pakistan to visit my grandparents, however, we found most of the photos had been lost during the moving process or misplaced. Losing these pictures felt like years worth of precious memories had been lost and they were saddened they weren't able to share these memories with me. 

I feel preserving both new and old photos of our loved ones is more important than ever, so we can share with our future generations and be able to look back at them at our convenience. In this age, memory archival has become vastly digitized, such that most of the photos we take are stored in our phones. However, this does not account for the past of our parents and grandparents, where most of their photos are physical due to film photography being the primary means of recording memories of their younger days. I want to contribute with this UX project by creating a website or app to preserve the precious memories of family members and make it convenient for any member of the family to upload the photos they have and view them all in one place. 

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, Collectionaire, documents family history and memories all in one place where it can be viewed by anyone in the family. The second, My Stories Matter, is a collaborative story book where family members can contribute journal entries and photos.
